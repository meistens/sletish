# WIP
It's basically a TG Bot for - not yet there - tracking media

- Why do this instead of using some other services?

I hate questions like this and similar. But nontheless, because I can?

- There are other services doing it and more, why waste your time building?

I mean yeah, there's a 1001 places to get cheap food, accomodation, and other stuff. But it is all about preference

I could be doing something intresting (more like making money) like an inventory management that does x to simplify the workflow of the staff (niche stuff), but I am not doing that... yet. But again, who wants to invest in someone targeting untapped niche markets when they can face big corpos?


*Stressed out, this is the fourth rewrite, had to give the one-liner to Claude to split, my patience already streched thin*

Anyhoo, no deployments yet (no, I WON'T touch Vercel).
All tests done using ngrok (it isn't perfect... yes, from the search functionality to... everything else)

But if you still want to try;

1. get bot token from @BotFather on Telegram
2. get a account on ngrok
3. install ngrok for whatever platform you use
4. follow ngrok instructions (terminal->authtoken)
5. start ngrok (instructions literally in the docs)
6. clone repo, provide your token from BotFather
7. setup webhook for the bot (look it up)
8. it should work (Jikan does not require API keys so yeah...)

That is all there is to this.
TBA on more changes...
